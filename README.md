Welcome all to my Offensive Security journey and first ever write up.
I have been active on ```HackTheBox``` since December 2020.
However I have only been able to work on fews machine during the last two years while learning about ```Info-Sec``` fundamentals on ```TryHackMe``` and others few online platforms, also while completed my degree.

Before dive in the the write up ```Jerry``` it's important to note that prior rooting the first machine on ```Hackthebox``` I have zero experiend in the ```Offensive Security```.
